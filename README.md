## Hi there I am Karan ðŸ‘‹

Hello, Iâ€™m Karan Lama Gurung.
Iâ€™m currently pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Information Technology at Informatics College Pokhara, where Iâ€™m in my second year. Over the past two years, Iâ€™ve been building a strong foundation in coding, especially in Java and Python. Recently, Iâ€™ve started exploring web development and Iâ€™m excited to keep learning and growing in this area.

Beyond academics, Iâ€™m passionate about technology, enjoy playing games, traveling, and diving into new topics out of curiosity. Iâ€™m eager to connect with others in the tech space, not just to learn, but to collaborate, share ideas, and work on real-world projects together.

Iâ€™m actively looking to be part of a developer or tech community where I can apply what Iâ€™ve learned, gain practical experience, and continue expanding my knowledge.
